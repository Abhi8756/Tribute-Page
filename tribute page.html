   <h4 class="he4">Intro</h4>
    <p>☛Sven Magnus Øen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen">Carlsen</a> is a Norwegian chess grandmaster who is a former five-time World Chess Champion and current four-time World Rapid Chess Champion and current six-time World Blitz Chess Champion.
        Carlsen has held the No.1 position in the FIDE world chess rankings since 1 July 2011 and trails only Garry Kasparov in time spent as the highest-rated player in the world.
        His peak rating of 2882 is the highest in history. 
        He also holds the record for the longest unbeaten streak at the elite level in classical chess.

   <h4 class="he4">The World Champion</h4>
    <p>
        VCarlsen became World Chess Champion in 2013 by defeating Viswanathan Anand. He retained his title against Anand the following year and won both the 2014 World Rapid Championship and World Blitz Championship, becoming the first player to hold all three titles simultaneously, a feat which he repeated in 2019 and 2022.
        He defended his classical world title against Sergey Karjakin in 2016, Fabiano Caruana in 2018, and Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021. 
        He declined to defend his title against Nepomniachtchi in 2023.

   <h4 class="he4">Learning the game</h4>
    <p>☛His father, a keen amateur chess player,[11] taught him to play at age five, although he initially showed little interest in it.[12] He has three sisters, and in 2010 stated that one thing that first motivated him to take up chess seriously was the desire to beat his elder sister at the game.
        Carlsen was coached at the Norwegian College of Elite Sport by the country's top player, Grandmaster (GM) Simen Agdestein,who in turn cites Norwegian football manager Egil "Drillo" Olsen as a key inspiration for his coaching strategy.
        In 2000, Agdestein introduced Carlsen to Torbjørn Ringdal Hansen, a former Norwegian junior champion and later International Master (IM) and Grandmaster (GM)

         Carlsen stated he wished for the app to encourage more people to play chess.[455][456]
         In March 2019, Play Magnus AS merged with Chess24.com, consolidating into the Play Magnus Group.[457] On 8 October 2020, Play Magnus Group was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.
